# Integration with Standart Sybsystems Liblary (SSL)

1. There is a possibility of convenient debugging of additional reports and data processors. More detailed at [wiki](https://github.com/cpr1c/tools_ui_1c/wiki/Отладка-внешних-обработок-БСП)
2. The "Tools" submenu is added to the lists and forms of objects, which contains items (The forms must be connected to the "Attachable Commands" subsystem):
	* **Add to Comparison** - adds selected objects to comparison for further use in the "Object Comparison" tool
	* **Edit Object** - Allows you to open the current object in the Attributes editor
	* **Compare Objects** - Opens the "Compare Objects" tool with selected links as comparison objects. Available only for lists.
    * **Find Object References** - Opens the "Find Object References" tool for the current object.
    * **Upload objects to XML** -Performs unloading of selected objects with subordinate links using the "Loading/Uploading XML" tool.


# Programming interface

## Connector: handy HTTP-client for 1C:Enterprise 8 platform

Accessible from the API via the common module **UT_HTTPConnector**. For a detailed description, see the library page https://github.com/vbondarevsky/Connector/blob/master/README-EN.md

Example:

`Result = HTTPConnector.GetJson("https://api.github.com/events");`

## Working with the OS clipboard

Available from API of module **UT_ClipboardClient**. Description of methods in the code. Synchronous and asynchronous operation modes are supported. https://github.com/cpr1c/clipboard_1c


Example of use: 
```bsl
УИ_БуферОбменаКлиент.КопироватьСтрокуВБуфер("Моя строка для копирования в буфер обмена");
``` 
 
## Retrieving the virtual table structure of a query or temporary table manager

It is necessary to call the function in the form of evaluating an expression **УИ_._ВТ(ЗапросИЛИМенеджерВременныхТаблиц)**. 

Example of use: 

`УИ_._ВТ(Запрос)`

`УИ_._ВТ(Запрос.МенеджерВременныхТаблиц)`

## Comparison of two value tables

It is necessary to call the function in the form of evaluating an expression **_ТЗСр(ТаблицаБазовая, ТаблицаСравнения, СписокКолонок)**. 

Example of use: 

`УИ_._ТЗСр(ТаблицаБазовая, ТаблицаСравнения)` - will perform comparison across all columns of the TableBase parameter

`УИ_._ТЗСр(ТаблицаБазовая, ТаблицаСравнения, "Номенклатура,Количество")`

## Serialization of XML into simple data structures (array, structure, map)

It is necessary to call the function in the form of evaluating an expression **_XMLОбъект(ПутьЧтения, УпроститьЭлементы)**. 

Example of use: 

`УИ_._XMLОбъект(ЧтениеXML)` - will crawl an existing XMLReader

`УИ_._XMLОбъект("C:\1.xml")` - will read into file structures

`УИ_._XMLОбъект(Поток)` - will read into stream structures

`УИ_._XMLОбъект("C:\1.xml", Ложь)` - will read into file structures without simplifying the resulting structures

# Debug
[Особенности использования отладки в портативной поставке](https://github.com/cpr1c/tools_ui_1c/wiki/Особенности-использования-отладки-в-портативном-варианте)
### Call

It is necessary to call the function **УИ_._От(ВашаПеременнаяОбъектаОтладки,НастройкиСКД)** in the form of evaluating an expression. Where instead ВашаПеременнаяОбъектаОтладки you need to pass a variable containing one of the objects available for debugging

### How it works

If the debug launch context is a thick client, the console form opens immediately after the end of the code call.

If debugging is called in the context of a server or a thin or web client, the necessary information is saved in the **Данные для отладки** reference. In this case, debugging is called later from the list of the "Данные для отладки" reference book. 


### Debugging of objects is supported:

* **Запрос**- queries without temporary table managers are currently being debugged.
Debug call  

`УИ_._От(Запрос)`

* **Data Composition Schema**- Debugging without external data sources is supported. 

Debug call:

`УИ_._От(СхемаКомпоновкиДанных,НастройкиСКД)` - debugging with the transferred settings will be called

`УИ_._От(СхемаКомпоновкиДанных)` - debugging with default settings for DCS will be called

`УИ_._От(СхемаКомпоновкиДанных,НастройкиСКД, ВнешниеНаборыДанных)` - debugging will be called with the transferred settings and external datasets

* **Reference object of the database**- viewing and editing the reference of the database

Debug call

`УИ_._от(СсылкаНаОбъектБД)`

* **HTTP Запрос**- debugging of string and file content of requests, as well as proxy is supported

Debug call

`УИ_._От(HTTPЗапрос,СоединениеHTTP)`

# Building into binaries

The build dependencies are now in the file : packagedef, in the build folder to install the dependencies, you must run the command `opm install`  from the root of the project.

Call the script file at the root of the repository

* **build.sh** - for Linux
* **build.bat** - for Windows

Available build options:
  * **--platformSource**  - Platform installation directory for building execution
  * **--versionEDT** - EDT version to perform conversion. To run through the RING utility. Must be specified if the system has more than one version of 1C: EDT
  * **--cfe** - Generate assembly in Extension format
  * **--cf** - Form the assembly as a configuration
   
Example 
`./build.sh ----platformSource=/opt/1cv8/x86_64/8.3.12.1924 --versionEDT=edt@2020.6.0`
